  <p> X rays have always fascinated me. As a little kid, the ability to see through objects seemed like a real-world supepower,
    and captured my attention. So naturally, many years later, when I stumbled across a homemade X-ray machine, I sought to construct my own.
    <br>
    <br>
    Several Resources were used to make the machine. The user "radhoo" in <a href="https://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?106277">this</a>
    forum post seems to be one of the first people online to make an X-ray machine using "ordinary" vacuum tubes, rather than utilizing expensive
    special-purpose X-ray tubes. As a result, many other builds seem to stem from his. Here are some other resources I used:

<p>
  The heart of the X-ray machine is a circuit that creates High voltage using parts from an old fashioned TV. The TVs were found in the trash around the block, and had the parts extracted. <br>

<p> Some examples of the type of TV used in this project. <p>

<br>
The machine design involves a ZVS driver circuit that powers an AC flyback transformer that is fed through a Cockroft-Walton Multiplier
Circuit to increase and multiply the volatge.
The high voltage output from the Cockroft-walton multiplier is then connected to the xray tube. <br>

<p>The "x-ray tube" utilized is an old <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=2c2s+tube&_sacat=0">2c2s</a>
   Soviet vacuum tube sourced from ebay. My first few attempts at the X-ray machine used American-made vacuum tubes. Ironically,
  the Soviet tubes functioned better as X-ray tubes because they were more poorly constructed than their American counterparts, so my attempts
  after that used Soviet tubes. <br><br>
Lead shielding from <a href="https://www.unitednuclear.com/"> United Nuclear</a> was purchased for protection. A long wire connected to a switch also
served as a "remote" for the circuit to offer additional protection. Later, I also added an arduino-controlled camera trigger so that I could
more easily control the picture quality of the X-ray machine. The camera was set to a long exposure with the widest aperature to capture the most light.
